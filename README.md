LOM curriculum data selecor
===========================

This is a JS component which can be used to simplify the selection of *curriculum information*, mainly in context of describing educational resources using the *[LOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_object_metadata)* standard. 

A little introduction
---------------------

*LOM* (*Learning Object Metadata*) is a standard used to describe educational resources. This standard defines several *property groups*, or *fields*, each describing a specific aspect of the resource. Field 9 is called *Classification*, and can be used to classify the resource using specific *curricula*. 

Furthermore, *[LOM-CH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_object_metadata#LOM-CH)*, a superset of *LOM* that is used in Switzerland, has a custom field, 10 *Curriculum*, which provides more flexibility for describing a resource in contect of a specific curriculum.

The selection of this data through an interface can be tedious. This component greatly simplifies the process, by allowing users to quickly find specific elements using a search, selecting full "paths" by selecting "leaf elements", easy browsing, etc.

------------

You can use [Bower](https://bower.io/) to install the component:

    bower install educach-curricula-ui
